README
Install the latest Godot version of the 3.4 branch. 3.4.2 was the most recent version at time of development. 

Follow this tutorial to install all prerequisites for VR development:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/vr/oculus_mobile/developing_for_oculus_quest.html
It explains:
    - Exporting for Android and setting up the Android SDK
    - Setting up Godot with the correct export settings and such for the Oculus/Meta Quest
    - Setting up and connecting the Quest to the PC 

The section regarding the OpenGL renderer and building the main scene/script should be ignored unless changing the environment or other modifications.
OpenGL 3.0 is perfect to use and the main scene already has these ARVR components and script code. 

You should now be able to deploy this project to your Quest by clicking the Android icon at the top right in Godot.
